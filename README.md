# Snake
###### The most realistic snake simulator of 2015

There's not much to say about this. It's a snake clone, programmed in C++ with SDL. It should run on just about anything.
The makefile included is pretty much exclusively used to compile on Mac OSX. There is also a Visual Studio project included.

Developed and tested with love on Mac OSX Yosemite.
Special thanks to [TyranDe](https://github.com/TyrenDe) for moral support, code review, and Visual Studio compatibility.
