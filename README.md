# Snake

There's not much to say about this. It's a snake clone. It should run on just about anything.

The makefile included is pretty much exclusively used to compile on Mac OSX. There is also a Visual Studio project included.

Development began in October 2015.

Special thanks to [TyranDe](https://github.com/TyrenDe) for moral support, code review, and Visual Studio compatibility.
